We (the maintainers of this repository) are not responsible for accurately representing the licensing status of third

for doing **your own** research about legal restrictions regarding the components being built.

We believe that most of Gstreamer is under an LGPL license of some kind, but we aren't 100% sure.

Gstreamer may have components which are legally restrictive (not covered by LGPL).  For example, many
components of [gst-plugins-ugly](https://github.com/GStreamer/gst-plugins-ugly) are especially restrictive.

Gstreamer may also depend on third party components which are legally restrictive in some way (we haven't checked).

We encourage users to do their own research into legal matters.
