We believe that most of Gstreamer is under an LGPL license of some kind, but we aren't 100% sure.

Gstreamer may have components which are legally restrictive (not covered by LGPL).  For example, some
components of [gst-plugins-ugly](https://github.com/GStreamer/gst-plugins-ugly) are especially restrictive.

Gstreamer may also depend on third party components which are legally restrictive in some way (we haven't checked).

We encourage users to do their own research into legal matters.
